Trie is a multiway tree built based on the prefix of strings

root node is empty and each node contains array of nodes initially all of them are null.

Each node stores alphabet and flag that represents true if it is end of word otherwise false.

Time complexity for add, search word and search prefix is O(K) where k iis the length of string.

pros: we can efficiently do prefix search
cons: need lof of space to store strings
